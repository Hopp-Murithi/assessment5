# Tasks
### Week 5 Assessment
- Create a custom post type named foods that classifies the groups of food e.g., Proteins, vitamins, etc. You should be able to publish these foods as posts. Food should have a title, thumbnail, and description. Utilize at least one Taxonomy associated with the post type. 

### Week 6 Assessment
- Using a plugin with class as service architecture and composer, create a menu that helps add all members of the WordPress cohort. Details to capture must include name, phone number and email. Add any other fields you desire. Another menu can be used to view all the members (this is a plus for you if you can beat the time). Activation and deactivation functions should be tested to work perfectly.
